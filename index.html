<h2>Professional tennis players: Older, fitter and better</h2>
<p><p>
	<h4>Thirty-somethings have never had it so good.
	As Paul Newman reports, the old guard in the men’s
	game are still holding off the younger generation,
	while many of the more senior women also continue 
	to thrive</h4><p>
	It was a moment that not only brought this summer’s
	 US Open crowd to their feet but also summed up the 
	 current balance of power in men’s tennis. Nick Kyrgios,
	 one of the most talented players of his generation, attempted to outfox Roger Federer, the ultimate leader of the old guard, with an exquisitely angled drop shot, only for the 37-year-old Swiss to chase the ball down and hit an extraordinary winner around the net post. As 23-year-old Kyrgios stood open-mouthed in amazement, Federer calmly walked away, just a hint of a smile breaking out across his face.

Federer’s run in New York would ultimately end
 in an unlikely fourth-round defeat to John Millman,
 but, as usual, another of the thirty-something generation 
 was on hand to pick up the baton. Novak Djokovic’s third US Open triumph was the ninth successive Grand Slam tournament
  in which the men’s singles title was won by a player 
  over the age of 30 – a run unparalleled in 141 years 
  of Grand Slam competition. With Marin Cilic celebrating his 30th birthday recently, there are now no active male players under the age of 30 who have won Grand Slam singles titles.
